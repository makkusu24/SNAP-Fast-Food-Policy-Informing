# SNAP-Fast-Food-Policy-Informing
Aggregate 3 large datasets on SNAP data per U.S. Census tract, fast food locations in the U.S., and city-county pairing information. Analysis shows counties with the highest combined SNAP benefits recipient proportion AND highest density of fast food locations, which can better inform public health policy, such as where to pilot sin tax programs.


# Additional Context
While the public is often swayed by marketing campaigns that promote "value meals," there's a lack of comprehensive data-driven studies that delve into the spatial relationship between fast-food restaurant density and SNAP usage, as it’s a pretty specific combination to look into. 

Moreover, a lot of existing discussions around food access often stop at food security, barely scratching the surface of deeper issues like food sovereignty and systemic inequality. I hope my project helps to shift the blame away from individual consumers for current food system issues (e.g., WE need to fix our diets and it’s OUR fault we’re eating so many calories), and instead goes toward the institutional roots of the problem such as food deserts and lack of walkable access to grocery stores.
